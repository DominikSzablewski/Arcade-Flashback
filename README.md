#### Why am I unable to access the main menu while having conversations with NPCs or playing the arcade game?

- Restricting access to the main menu during NPC conversations and arcade gameplay is a deliberate design choice aimed at enhancing immersion and gameplay fluidity. By maintaining the continuity of interactions, the game ensures that players remain fully engaged in conversations and arcade action, without distracting menu navigation elements.
